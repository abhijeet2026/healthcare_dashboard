# 🏥 Healthcare Operational & Patient Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze 30,000+ patient records, focusing on hospital operational efficiency, department performance, and patient care quality. This project transforms complex healthcare data into intuitive visuals for hospital administrators.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Tool:** Power BI (End-to-End)
- **Data Transformation:** Power Query (ETL)
- **Modeling:** Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)
- **Analytics:** Advanced DAX, Descriptive Analytics, Trend Forecasting

## 🔍 Healthcare Specific Insights (KPIs)
- **Patient Volume Analysis:** Daily/Monthly trends of patient admissions across different departments (ER, Cardiology, OPD, etc.).
- **ALOS (Average Length of Stay):** Calculated the average duration of stay per patient to identify bottlenecks in discharge processes.
- **Departmental Efficiency:** Benchmarked departments based on patient-to-bed ratio and average treatment costs.
- **Revenue & Billing:** Analyzed insurance claim approval rates vs. out-of-pocket expenses for patients.

## 🚀 Key Features & Analytical Depth
- **Interactive Patient Journey:** Used slicers and drill-throughs to track patient flow from admission to discharge.
- **Resource Optimization:** Identified peak hours in the Emergency Room to help with better staff scheduling.
- **Quality of Care Metrics:** Tracked re-admission rates to monitor medical care effectiveness.
- **Insurance Analytics:** Visualized the distribution of insurance providers and their respective claim settlement timelines.

## 🧹 Power Query & Data Modeling
- **Data Shaping:** Cleaned and transformed raw healthcare datasets using Power Query.
- **DAX Implementation:** Created complex measures for ALOS and Mortality Rate trends.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Implemented custom tooltips and bookmarks for a seamless user experience.
